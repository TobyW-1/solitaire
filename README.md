In-console card game

Fully playable in the console.

I created this primarily to practice classes and inheritance.
I followed no brief, and all the code came out of my head (with the usual research to solve problems).
I just had the standard rules of the game in mind.

I have learnt a lot from working on this, and there are certainly things I would approach differently if re-doing the project.

Once one is used to moving the cards around, it is relatively playable for a text based version of a card game.

There are a few tweaks that I would like to make:
    - Add in handlers for exceptions to cope with bad user input (a bit more elegant than my if/else statements)
    - Work on simpler user input
    - Add functionality to restart the current game
    - Add an "Undo" button
    - Allow the user to advance the spares pile by 2 or 1 card, as this makes a win much more likely.
    - The user interface can be worked on - the lists of cards in the 7 main columns can get messy later on in the game as they get longer.
